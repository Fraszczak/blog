## Introduction
TypeScript is a technology that has gained a lot of popularity in the programming world since its inception. It is an extension of JavaScript, adding many valuable functionalities to it, such as classes, interfaces, enumerations, type annotations and much more. These features make your code more readable and easier to understand. In addition, TypeScript allows developers to write more complex applications that are more error-tolerant.

## Advantages of TypeScript

There are several advantages to using TypeScript over other programming languages. Some key benefits include:

#### Typing system

One of the most significant advantages of TypeScript is its typing system. TypeScript provides a way to define the types of variables, functions, and other objects in the code. By defining types, the compiler can catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, which helps to eliminate many common bugs and improve the overall quality of the code.
It's framework with strong typing system, some people say. Structural, or static, other can say. Depending on of context, all of them have a seed of truth in it. After some time with this framework, the nearest definition for me is that, is gradually typed.
You can read more about that here, in [type-safety](/en/type-safety)

```javascript
// JavaScript
const myVariable = someObject; // we are vulnerable to runtime type errors

// TypeScript
const myVariable: MyType = someObject; // thanks to typing, we will catch type errors during compilation
```

#### JavaScript Compatibility

TypeScript is fully compatible with JavaScript, meaning you can use it alongside your existing JavaScript code. The ability to gradually implement TypeScript into existing JavaScript code makes TypeScript easy to implement into existing projects.

#### Improved Tooling

TypeScript has excellent tooling support, including autocomplete, type checking, and refactoring tools, that can help speed up development and reduce the likelihood of errors. IDEs and text editors such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, and Sublime Text all have built-in support for TypeScript.

#### Compatibility with Popular Libraries and Frameworks

TypeScript is compatible with many popular libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. This makes it easy for developers to use TypeScript with technologies that are already widely adopted and popular in the programming world.

#### Easy Refactoring

Thanks to its strong type system, refactoring code is much easier in TypeScript than in JavaScript. Changes to the code are easier to make because TypeScript detects where changes are needed and informs the developer accordingly. This makes it easier to maintain and develop code in the future.

#### Better Documentation

TypeScript allows developers to define types, making code more readable and easier to understand. Types can also be documented, making it easier for other developers to use the code. This leads to better documentation and understanding of code, which helps teams work more efficiently together.

## Disadvantages of TypeScript

Despite its many advantages, TypeScript does have some drawbacks, including:

#### Additional Learning Time

For developers who are not familiar with typing, learning TypeScript may take some time. It is necessary to learn new concepts and ways of defining types. However, once developers get used to the typing system, they may find that it actually saves them time in the long run.

#### Increased Code Complexity

Adding typing to code increases its complexity. Developers must write more code to define types, which can lead to a larger number of lines of code. However, this can also make the code more maintainable and scalable in the long run.

## Summary

TypeScript is a powerful programming language that offers many benefits for developers. With its strong type system, TypeScript enables developers to write more secure and error-resistant code. It works with many popular libraries and frameworks, making it easy to write web applications. Learning TypeScript may require some time. Introduction and use may initially slow down the software development process, and in the case of a complex project, it may additionally increase the entry threshold.
